# Spreadsheet Application

A browser-based spreadsheet application with Excel-like functionality, fully implemented in Rust.

This application is a complete rewrite of a legacy spreadsheet tool from C to Rust, enhanced with modern features and a browser GUI using WebAssembly. It features a modular, maintainable, and performant design with support for advanced operations like dependency-tracked formulas, graph plotting, and file sharing.

## üåê Webserver

### Public Endpoints
- **Authentication**: `/login`, `/signup`, `/logout`, `/reset-password`, `/forgot-password`, `/change-password`
- **Public Access**: `/:username/:sheet_name` for read-only sheet access
- **Data Operations**: `/api/update_cell`, `/api/save`, `/api/load`, `/api/graph`, `/api/export`
- **Downloads**: `/api/download/csv`, `/api/download/xlsx`
- **API Access**: `/api/sheet`, `/api/cell/:cell_name`, `/api/sheet_info` for read-only data
- **Static Content**: Static assets from `/static`

### Protected Endpoints
- **Sheet Management**: `/sheet` for editing UI
- **File Operations**: `/:username` (file listing), `/:username/create` (create new sheet),
  `/:username/:sheet_name/status` (update access), `/:username/:sheet_name/delete` (deletion)

### Middleware Logic
- Auth checks via `require_auth` middleware for protected endpoints
- Session map maintained for user state with expiration time
- Public/private file access logic via metadata in `list.json`
- Redirection to login page for unauthorized access attempts

## üß† Key Design Decisions

### Data Structures
- `Spreadsheet`: Container for cells, viewport management, undo stack
- `Cell`: Value, formula, dependents, location storage
- `Formula` enum: Extensible function handling with variant types
- Hybrid approach for dependency tracking:
  - `Vec` for initial, small dependency lists
  - `OrderedSet` (AVL tree) for larger dependency collections
- Tuple indices `(row, col)` instead of strings for memory efficiency

### Optimizations
- `regex` for one-time formula parsing (no repeated parsing)
- `lazy_static!` for precompiled regexes
- Topological sort for dependency-ordered recalculation
- `u16` for index compression to save memory
- Stack-based recursion elimination
- Sparse cell storage to reduce memory footprint

### Communication Flow
1. User actions trigger WebAssembly functions
2. WebAssembly communicates with Rust backend
3. Backend processes commands and updates state
4. Dependency resolution triggers recalculation
5. Updated state returns to frontend for rendering
6. Changes persist to storage in compressed format

---

## üìâ Performance Optimizations

- Reduced memory footprint with sparse cell storage
- Use of `u16` for row/column indices instead of larger types
- Optimized dependency graph updates with topological ordering
- No redundant formula parsing (one-time evaluation)
- Precompiled regex + tuple indices for faster dependency lookups
- Profiling with `flamegraph` used to identify and improve bottlenecks
- Optimized memory allocation by reusing data structures

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Covered Edge Cases

### Circular Dependencies
- Direct cycles (e.g., A1 = B1, B1 = A1)
- Indirect cycles through multiple cells
- Self-referential cells (e.g., A1 = A1)
- Non-obvious cycles (e.g., A1 = 0*B1, B1 = A1)

### Formula Errors
- Invalid formula syntax (e.g., 1++1, unrecognized functions)
- Missing arguments (e.g., MAX(), SLEEP())
- Division by zero and error cascading
- Out-of-bounds cell references

### Sleep Functions
- Normal sleep operation
- Cascaded SLEEP cells
- Negative sleep values
- Error propagation through sleep functions

### General Edge Cases
- Empty/invalid commands
- Large scrolling behavior
- Dependency graph correctness
- Error propagation through complex dependencies

## üß™ Primary Data Structures

- **Spreadsheet**: Core container storing cells, viewport, and undo stack
- **Cell**: Stores formula, value, dependents, and location
- **Formula (enum)**: Represents different formula types with variant data
- **Vector**: Used for temporary storage and initial dependency lists
- **OrderedSet (AVL Tree)**: For efficient storage of large dependency collections
- **Directed Acyclic Graph**: Models dependencies between cells
- **Linked List**: Used for topological sort ordering
- **Stack**: Implements undo/redo logic and eliminates recursion

---

## ‚ûï Future Enhancements

- Drag and drop support in GUI
- VLOOKUP/HLOOKUP and more Excel functions
- Multi-cell selection in GUI
- Floating-point formula support (e.g., `f32` vs `i32`)
- Further performance optimizations for large spreadsheets
